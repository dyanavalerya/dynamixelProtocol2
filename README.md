# Dynamixel Protocol 2.0 Library

## Objectives

+ Become familiar with low-level programming
+ Learn how to make a library
+ Learn C++ and how to run it on hardware devices

## Project description

This library is used to facilitate communication between an Arduino and a Dynamixel motor using the Dynamixel Protocol 2.0.

**Used tools:** C++
**Used hardware:** Crust Crawler manipulator with Dynamixel motors, Arduino Mega, RS485 Breakout board. 

**File description:**
+ `dynamixel2.h` contains the declarations of the classes, structures, functions, and any constants used in the library
+ `communication.h` contains the templates that the library uses
+ `dynamixel2.cpp` contains the function definitions

## How to use

In order to get an overview of how to use the library, check out the *Examples* folder.

It is necessary to have all the mentioned above hardware, the Arduino IDE installed, and the *DynamixelProtocol2* library added to the *libraries* folder of your Arduino program.
